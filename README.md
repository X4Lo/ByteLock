## About ByteLock

ByteLock is a simple yet powerful CLI tool designed to encrypt and decrypt files using industry-standard encryption algorithms. It leverages modern cryptographic techniques such as AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305, ensuring your data remains secure. Whether you need to protect sensitive documents or share encrypted files, ByteLock provides an easy-to-use interface for all your encryption needs.

## Key Features

- **Secure Encryption**: Utilizes AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithms.
- **Customizable Salt Size**: Supports salt sizes of 16, 32, and 64 bytes for added security.
- **Compression Option**: Optionally compress files before encryption (feature coming soon).
- **Progress Tracking**: Displays progress bars during encryption and decryption processes.
- **Output Flexibility**: Allows specifying custom output paths for encrypted/decrypted files.
- **Delete Original**: Option to automatically delete the original file after encryption.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using ByteLock, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust**: Install Rust by following the instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **Cargo**: Comes bundled with Rust; used to build and manage the project.

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: From Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/X4Lo/ByteLock.git
cd ByteLock
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

3. Run the executable:
```bash
./target/release/bytelock
```

#### Option 2: Precompiled Binaries

Download the latest release from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/X4Lo/ByteLock/releases) and extract it to your desired location.

## Usage

### Encrypting a File

```bash
bytelock crypt <file_path> --password <your_password> --output <output_path> --algo AES-256-GCM --zip --delete-original --salt 32
```

**Example:**
```bash
bytelock crypt document.txt --password mysecurepassword --output encrypted_document.bytelock --algo AES-256-GCM --salt 32
```

### Decrypting a File

```bash
bytelock decrypt <encrypted_file_path> --password <your_password> --output <output_path> --algo AES-256-GCM
```

**Example:**
```bash
bytelock decrypt encrypted_document.bytelock --password mysecurepassword --output decrypted_document.txt --algo AES-256-GCM
```

### Command-Line Help

For more details, use the `--help` flag:
```bash
bytelock --help
```

## Security Architecture

ByteLock employs a robust multi-layered approach to ensure the security and integrity of your data. Here's an overview of its architecture:

1. **File Structure**:
   - Encrypted files generated by ByteLock consist of three main components:
     1. **Metadata Nonce**: A randomly generated nonce used for encrypting the metadata.
     2. **Encrypted Metadata**: The serialized metadata header, encrypted using AES-256-GCM with the metadata nonce.
     3. **Encrypted Content**: The actual file content, encrypted in chunks using the specified algorithm (e.g., AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305).

2. **Encryption Process**:
   - **Chunk-Based Encryption**: To handle large files efficiently, ByteLock divides the file content into chunks of 1 MB each. Each chunk is encrypted independently, ensuring that even large files can be processed without excessive memory usage.
   - **Progress Tracking**: A progress bar is displayed during the encryption process, showing the percentage of completion and estimated time remaining.

3. **Cryptographic Materials**:
   - **Salt Generation**: A random salt is generated for each encryption operation, preventing rainbow table attacks.
   - **Nonce Management**: Unique nonces are generated for both metadata encryption and content encryption to ensure message uniqueness.
   - **Key Derivation**: Password-based key derivation uses Argon2id with configurable memory cost, time cost, and parallelism, making it resistant to brute-force attacks.

4. **Authentication**:
   - Both metadata and file content are encrypted using authenticated encryption algorithms (AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305), ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering.

5. **Decryption Process**:
   - During decryption, ByteLock first extracts and decrypts the metadata to retrieve the necessary cryptographic parameters (e.g., salt, nonce). It then decrypts the file content in chunks, reconstructing the original file.

By adhering to modern cryptographic best practices, ByteLock ensures that your data remains secure and protected against unauthorized access.
